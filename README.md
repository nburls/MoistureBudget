# Moisture Budget Analysis Code

This repo contains Python and Matlab scripts for performing a moisture budget analysis on climate model output.

For the python code there are three versions: 1) Using the output on its native grid (hybrid sigma pressure vertical coordinate) 2 & 3) regridding the vertical to fixed pressure levels using two different methods.

The code is tested using the output from two Community Atmospheric Model v5 (CAM5) simulations that have both the meridional (VQ) and zonal (UQ) moisture transport terms saved. 

The model output files used for testing are too big to upload so contact me directly if you would like to use them.
